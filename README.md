# Morph

**Morph** is a stacking, tiling, and scrolling hybrid compositor built with wlroots.

## Current Features

- Three layouts: stack, tile grid, and horizontal scroll
- 9 workspaces with switch/move actions and IPC commands
- INI-style keybind configuration with optional shell `when` predicates
- Tiling rules ([tile_rule]) and decoration rules ([decoration_rule]) by regex.
- Layer-shell workarea handling via exclusive zones
- Optional Xwayland support for X11 clients
- Environment-driven launcher/runtime settings, including XKB keyboard defaults

## Current Protocol Support

- `zwlr_layer_shell_v1` (tested with Waybar/swaybg)
- `zwlr_screencopy_manager_v1` (tested with grim)
- `ext_workspace_manager_v1` (tested with Waybar ext/workspaces)
- `zwlr_foreign_toplevel_manager_v1`
- `zxdg_decoration_manager_v1`
- `zwp_pointer_constraints_v1`
- `zwp_relative_pointer_manager_v1`
- `zwp_tablet_manager_v2`

See [`docs/PROTOCOLS.md`](docs/PROTOCOLS.md) for the exact matrix of implemented and missing globals.

## Current Repository Structure

| Path | Purpose |
|---|---|
| [`config/`](config/) | Runtime defaults, user hook templates, portal setup, and sample `morph.conf` |
| [`docs/`](docs/) | Current project documentation |
| [`docs_old/`](docs_old/) | Archived previous documentation snapshot kept during the current doc restructure |
| [`protocols/`](protocols/) | Wayland protocol XML files used for generated protocol code |
| [`scripts/`](scripts/) | Session wrappers, install helpers, and managed lifecycle scripts |
| [`sessions/`](sessions/) | Desktop entries for production and development sessions |
| [`src/`](src/) | Morph compositor source code |
| [`testing/`](testing/) | Manual runbooks, launcher assets, and example session files |
| [`tests/`](tests/) | Automated tests for config and shell/runtime behavior |

## What to Read First

- [`docs/OVERVIEW.md`](docs/OVERVIEW.md) for the documentation map, repository structure, and managed session flows
- [`docs/CONFIG.md`](docs/CONFIG.md) for compositor config syntax and hook definitions
- [`docs/LAUNCHER.md`](docs/LAUNCHER.md) for wrapper behavior, managed hooks, and runtime files
- [`docs/CLI.md`](docs/CLI.md) for binary command-line flags and IPC-aware runtime control
- [`docs/ENVIRONMENT.md`](docs/ENVIRONMENT.md) for runtime environment variables and XKB-related settings
- [`docs/TESTING.md`](docs/TESTING.md) for build, test, smoke-check, and manual validation workflows

## Build and Run

```bash
meson setup build
meson compile -C build
./build/morph
```

Recommended development launcher:

```bash
./testing/morph_run
```

Useful runtime overrides:

- [`MORPH_DBG=0|1|2`](docs/ENVIRONMENT.md#morph-dbg)
- [`MORPH_CONFIG=/path/to/config`](docs/ENVIRONMENT.md#morph-config)
- [`MORPH_ALLOW_BUILTIN_FALLBACK=1`](docs/ENVIRONMENT.md#morph-allow-builtin-fallback)
- [`MORPH_X11=0|1`](docs/ENVIRONMENT.md#morph-x11)
- [`MORPH_X11_DISPLAY=:12`](docs/ENVIRONMENT.md#morph-x11-display)

## Tests

Run the automated suite with:

```bash
meson test -C build --print-errorlogs
```

For the broader local workflow, including smoke checks and manual validation entry points, see [`docs/TESTING.md`](docs/TESTING.md).

## Install Paths

`meson install -C build` installs:

- `morph` and `morph-session` under the configured `bindir`
- runtime hooks and base files under `sysconfdir/morph`
- `morph.desktop` under `share/wayland-sessions`
- selected docs and reference files under `share/doc/morph`

For development installs and conservative uninstall behavior, see:

- [`scripts/dev-install.sh`](scripts/dev-install.sh)
- [`scripts/system-uninstall.sh`](scripts/system-uninstall.sh)
- [`docs/LAUNCHER.md`](docs/LAUNCHER.md)

## Runtime Notes

- wlroots `0.19.x` API is targeted
- X11 support depends on `xwayland-satellite` plus `xorg-xwayland`
- Disable X11 satellite with [`MORPH_X11=0`](docs/ENVIRONMENT.md#morph-x11)
- Java/X11 apps may need [`_JAVA_AWT_WM_NONREPARENTING=1`](docs/ENVIRONMENT.md#java-awt-wm-nonreparenting)
