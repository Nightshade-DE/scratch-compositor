## Reading Guide

If you are new to the project, use this order:

1. Read [`README.md`](../README.md) for the short project overview and top-level entry points.
2. Read this file for the repository map and the high-level runtime flows.
3. Continue with the detail document that matches your current goal.

Choose the next document by question:

## Repository Structure

This section is intentionally more detailed than the root [`README.md`](../README.md). The goal is to show where the important moving parts live before the flow diagrams reference them.

## Managed Session Overview

This is the ready-made **Morph** session path used by login managers or by users who want the full managed lifecycle.

## Wrapper Flow

The wrapper is the ready-made session entrypoint. It turns a display-manager or shell launch into a predictable **Morph** session with layered environment loading, layered config lookup, and managed hook wiring.

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A["Login manager / TTY / manual start"]
    B["morph.desktop"]
    C["morph-session"]
    D["Load environment layers"]
    E["Resolve config path"]
    F["Enable managed hook mode"]
    G["Export MORPH_* variables"]
    H["exec morph"]

    A --> B --> C --> D --> E --> F --> G --> H
```

- The wrapper exists to keep session setup reproducible.
- It is the best entrypoint when you want **Morph** to own the full session lifecycle.
- A custom launcher can replace parts of this flow, but then it must deliberately take over those responsibilities.

## Startup Flow

Startup is split into a managed system layer and an optional user layer. This keeps compositor-owned setup reliable while still leaving room for per-user services and applications.

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A["morph binary starts"]
    B["Read startup hook path"]
    C["Resolve managed startup hook"]
    D["scripts/system_startup.sh"]
    E["Prepare nested/native session state"]
    F["Start managed portal/session pieces"]
    G["config/startup.sh"]
    H["Launch user services and applications"]
    I["Startup complete"]

    A --> B --> C --> D --> E --> F --> G --> H --> I
```

- [`system_startup.sh`](../scripts/system_startup.sh) owns the compositor-side startup preparation.
- [`config/startup.sh`](../config/startup.sh) stays user-facing and is the place for autostart services, panels, bars, terminals, and similar additions.
- In managed mode, the system hook always runs before the user startup hook.

Read the detailed behavior in [`Startup Hook Resolution`](LAUNCHER.md#startup-hook-resolution) in `docs/LAUNCHER.md`.

## Reload Flow

Reload keeps the same layering model as startup: **Morph** first re-enters the managed reload hook, then hands control to the optional user reload hook.

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A["Reload command"]
    B["Morph resolves reload hook"]
    C["scripts/system_reload.sh"]
    D["Run managed reload tasks"]
    E["config/reload.sh"]
    F["Run user reload tasks"]
    G["Return to running session"]

    A --> B --> C --> D --> E --> F --> G
```

- This flow is useful for restarting bars, launchers, notification daemons, or other session components without tearing down the full session.
- The helper layer can also provide guarded commands such as one-shot reload helpers.

Read the detailed behavior in [`Reload Resolution`](LAUNCHER.md#reload-resolution) in `docs/LAUNCHER.md`.

## Shutdown Flow

Shutdown intentionally inverts the startup order for the user-facing part: the user shutdown hook runs first, and the managed cleanup finishes last.

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A["Morph exits / session ends"]
    B["Morph resolves shutdown hook"]
    C["config/shutdown.sh"]
    D["Run user shutdown tasks"]
    E["scripts/system_shutdown.sh"]
    F["Run managed cleanup"]
    G["Portals and tracked processes are stopped"]
    H["Session cleanup complete"]

    A --> B --> C --> D --> E --> F --> G --> H
```

- [`config/shutdown.sh`](../config/shutdown.sh) is the user-facing place for manual cleanup.
- [`system_shutdown.sh`](../scripts/system_shutdown.sh) owns the managed cleanup and should be the final step so the compositor can clean up the session state it created.

Read the detailed behavior in [`Shutdown Hook Resolution`](LAUNCHER.md#shutdown-hook-resolution) in `docs/LAUNCHER.md`.

## Standalone Binary Flow

**Morph** can also be started without [`morph-session`](../scripts/morph-session). In that case, the binary can still use user hooks, system hooks, or a mixed setup depending on how the config and environment are prepared.

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A["Manual shell / custom launcher / direct exec"]
    B["Optional custom environment setup"]
    C["Optional custom config selection"]
    D["morph binary"]
    E["Load morph.conf"]
    F["Resolve startup / reload / shutdown hooks"]
    G["Optional managed system hooks"]
    H["Optional user hooks"]
    I["Morph running"]

    A --> B --> C --> D --> E --> F --> I
    F -.-> G
    F -.-> H
```

- This is the most flexible mode.
- It is also the mode where the caller must be explicit about which pieces of the managed session stack should still be reused.
- A custom wrapper can selectively replace [`morph-session`](../scripts/morph-session) while still keeping **Morph**'s system hooks.

## Building Blocks

The session architecture is intentionally a small set of reusable parts rather than one indivisible launcher.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    A["Custom launcher"]
    B["morph-session"]
    C["Environment layer resolver"]
    D["Config resolver"]
    E["System startup / reload / shutdown"]
    F["User startup / reload / shutdown"]
    G["morph binary"]

    A --> C
    A --> D
    A --> G

    B --> C
    B --> D
    B --> G

    G --> E
    G --> F
```

- [`morph-session`](../scripts/morph-session) is a ready-made orchestrator, not a hard requirement.
- Environment resolution can stay in shell space where it remains flexible.
- Config parsing belongs to **Morph** because it is the compositor-facing interface.
- System hooks provide the managed lifecycle.
- User hooks remain the extension points for local customization.

## Typical Usage Modes

- Managed session: [`morph.desktop`](../sessions/morph.desktop) -> [`morph-session`](../scripts/morph-session) -> `Morph` -> `System hooks` -> `User hooks`
- Binary with managed hooks: direct **Morph** start, but the resolved hooks still point at the managed system hooks
- Binary with custom user hooks: direct **Morph** start with user-provided hook paths
- Custom wrapper: a user-defined launcher reuses only the building blocks it wants
